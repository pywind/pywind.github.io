# Machine Learning 

### Right now, I'm on my way to machine learning. Take a look at the tag to see if there is anything interesting to you!

> In those posts, I really want to convey everything I've learned and recorded but it's hard! So I just annotated the most important parts. Try to study first and read it again!

Briefly about Machine Learning, the focus is mainly on supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

* Come to [`linear regression`](https://pywind.github.io//Linear-Regression), [`logistic regression`](https://pywind.github.io//Logistic-Regression), `KNN` to better understand supervised learning.

* On the other hand, [K-Means](https://pywind.github.io//K-mean) is characteristic of unsupervised learning.

And if your model training is having trouble. See how to improve algorithm optimization [**here**](https://pywind.github.io//advance/)
