## Some useful function **C#**

* $"" string

```cs
int n = 3, m = 5;
string s = "New string";
Console.Write($"This is {s}, {s.ToUpper()} and we can show {n} & {m} or {m * n}");
//This is New string, NEW STRING and we can show 3 & 5 or 15
```

* List example

```cs
    // Declare list
    var names = new List<string> { "Apple", "Organ", "Banana" };
```

* List `foreach (var index in <List>)`
* List`.Count();`
* List`.IndexOf("element_find")`; return index or -1
* List.Sort()
* List.Add() "Add more index"

> String

* Replace

```cs
"3ndl3arn".Replace('3', 'e');
//endlearn
"Blackcat".Replace("Black", "White");
//Whitecat
```

* s.ToUpper() / s.ToLower()
* IndexOf

```cs
string s = "This is example";
s.IndexOf("is"); // 5
s.IndexOf("not"); // -1
```

*  StartsWith & EndsWith

```cs
string name = "Pywind's blog C#";

name.StartsWith("P"); // true
name.StartsWith("Pywind"); // true

name.EndsWith("blog"); // false

```

* Split

```cs
string s = "Welcome to my blog";
string[] words = s.Split(' '); //["Welcome", "to", "my", "blog"]
```

* Substring

```cs
string name = "A string to test !";
// from index a to b
name.substring(0, 4) // A str
name.substring(2, 7) // string
```


# OOP in C#

```cs
class Name
{
    <access range><component>;
}
```

E.g:

```cs
class Animal
{
    private double weight;
    private double height;

    public double Height { get => height; set => height = value; }
    public double Weight { get => weight; set => weight = value; }

    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(" Animal is running. . .");
    }
}
```

## Declare

by new operator:

```cs
Animal Cat = new Animal();
```

> Class is the reference data type, is stored on the heap

### Usage

Call attributions:

```cs
<Name object>.<method>(<reference>);
```

### Constructor and Destructor

#### Constructor

* no arguments
  * initializes default values ​​for properties inside the class on object initialization
* arguments
  * When the object is instantiated for this method to be called, we need to pass all the parameters.
  * to initialize values ​​for properties inside the class during object initialization

```cs
// no argument
public Cat()
{
    Weight = 1.5; // Default values
    Height = 10;
}

// has argument
public Cat(int w, int h)
{
    Weight = w;
    Height = h;
}
```

#### Destructor

> Special methods are called before an object is retrieved.

* Having the same name as the class name, but to distinguish it from the constructor, we add a "~" sign before the class name.
* There is no return type.
* If you do not declare destructor, C # will automatically create a default destructor.
* There is only 1 destructor in 1 layer.

### Access specifiers and meaning

| Range | Mean  |
|:---|:---|
|  `public` | Unlimited. access anywhere  |
|  `private` | Only accessible inside the class  |
| `protected`  |  Like `private` & accessible from derived classes |
| `internal`  |  access in the same project |
| `protected internal`  | Like `internal` & accessible from derived classes   |

> Since it doesn't specify keywords, the class will have `internal`.

### Get and set method

* The query methods should start with the **get** keyword and be followed by the name of the property
* The update methods should start with the **set** keyword followed by the property name.
* If the property is boolean, the query method name must begin with the keyword **is** and be followed by the property name.
* The update method return type void and have 1 parameter passed with the same type as the data type of the property.
* Syntax:

```cs
<data type> <name of property>
{
    get { return <name of property>; }
    set { <name of property> = value; }
}
```

E.g:

```cs
private double diemLy;
public double DiemLy
{
get { return diemLy; }
set { diemLy = value; }
}
```

* Depending on the needs and security, the programmer can prevent value assignment or prevent data from being obtained by omitting the corresponding keyword.

```cs
set
{
    if (value <= 10 && value >=0 )
    {
        phys = value;
    }
}
```

### Static members

> Sometimes a programmer wants a certain property to be shared by all objects (to be allocated only one memory area). Since then the concept of static members came into being.

Characteristics:

* Initialized **once** only after compiling the program.
* Can be **used for all** subjects.
* **Called by class name**.
* Have: **static variable, static method, static class, static constructor**.
  
#### Static variable

```cs
<access_range> static <data_type> <name_variable> = <values>;
```

E.g:

```
public static int Count = 0;
```

#### Static method

* Static method is common function of class. Called by class name, no initialize, avoid waste of memory.
* Support to write utilities function.
  
```cs
<access> static <return_type> <name_method>
{
    // purpose inside
}
```

#### Static class

* Can contain static methods, static variables.

```cs
<access_range> static class <name_class>
{
// attributes
}
```

## Inheritance

* build a new class from an existing class.
  * A new class is called *subclass* or *derived class*.
  * An existing class is called a *superclass* or a *base class*.
* Reuse and easy to upgrade, easy to maintain.
  
Syntax:

```cs
class <name_subclass> : <superclass>
{
//
}
```

### Issues in inheritance

> The superclass default constructor is always called every time an object of the subclass is initialized. And called before the subclass constructor.
> Subclass must have a corresponding constructor and call the superclass constructor method through the keyword **base**.

Syntax:

```cs
public <name_class>(<parameter list of subclass>) : base(<parameter list>)
{
    //content
}
```

* `parameter list` is the parameter list corresponding to the constructor of the superclass.

E.g:

```cs
public class Animal
{
    private double Weight;
    private double Height;
    private double Legs;
    public Animal()
    {
        Height = 1000;
        Weight = 100;
        Legs = 4;
    }
    public Animal(double w, double h, int l)
    {
        Weight = w;
        Height = h;
        Legs = l;
    }
}
public class Cat : Animal
{

    public Cat(double w, double h, int l) : base(w, h, l)
    {
    //
    }
}
```

* In C # there is support for the **new** keyword to mark this as a **new** function and the function inheriting from the superclass will be masked so that the outside cannot be called.

> An object of the superclass can refer to the memory of an object belonging to the subclass, but otherwise cannot.

## Polymorphism

### Virtual and override

* Virtual is the keyword used to declare a virtual method (virtual methods are overridden methods).
* Override is the keyword used to mark the method that overrides the method of the superclass.

Note: 
{: .notice}

* Only override virtual or abstract methods.
* Polymorphism is only shown when the superclass method is overridden.

> We need to override the Speak() method of the superclass (Animal class) and to override it, we need to declare the Speak() method of the superclass as a virtual method.

```cs
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(" Animal is speaking. . .");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(" Cat is speaking. . .");
    }
}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(" Dog is speaking. . .");
    }
}
```

### Abstract class and pure virtual method

* A pure virtual method is a virtual method and has no internal definition.
* The abstract class is the class that contains pure virtual methods.
* Abstract is the keyword used to declare an abstract class or a pure virtual method.

**Note**: When inheriting an abstract class you are required to override all pure virtual methods to ensure program validity.
