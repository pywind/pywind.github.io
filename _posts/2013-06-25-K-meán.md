## Generality

* Other than supervised learning, here we don't know the labels for each data point.
* The task is to classify the data into clusters so that the clusters have similar properties
* A cluster is a collection of points close together in space:
  * Each cluster has a center, the points near it are assigned labels of that center

## Mathematics

### General

* N data points $$X = [x_1, x_2,x_3,...,x_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{d.N}$$
* K < N is number of clusters.
  * Find center $$M = [m_1,m_2,...m_k]\in\mathbb{R}^d$$
  * Set $$y=[y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$$ where $$y_i$$ is the label of $$x_i$$
  * If $$x_i$$ is classified into cluster k, then $$y_i$$ = k
* Sign: $$y_{i}^{(k)}\in\left\{0,1\right \},\sum_{k=1}^{k}y_{i}^{(k)}=1$$ it mean each point belongs only to a single cluster.
  
### Cost function

* $$m_k$$ is the center of each cluster and estimates the points in this cluster.
* Each point $$x_i$$ in cluster k has error is $$(x_i - m_k)$$.
  * Error: $$\left\|x_i-m_k\right\|^2$$ (Euclidean norm, "euclidean distance")

Summary, Cost function for data set is:
 $$C(y, m)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{K}y_{j}^{(i)}\left \|x_i-m_j\right\|^2$$

And we must find:
$$y, m = \underset{y,m}{arg\,min}\;\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{K}y_{j}^{(i)}\left \|x_i-m_j\right\|^2$$

> This is a two-variable function, so the easiest solution is to fix one variable and find the other as you learned in high school.
