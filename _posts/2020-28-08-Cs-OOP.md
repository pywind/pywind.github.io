## Some useful function **C#**

* $"" string

```cs
int n = 3, m = 5;
string s = "New string";
Console.Write($"This is {s}, {s.ToUpper()} and we can show {n} & {m} or {m * n}");
//This is New string, NEW STRING and we can show 3 & 5 or 15
```

* List example

```cs
    // Declare list
    var names = new List<string> { "Apple", "Organ", "Banana" };
```

* List `foreach (var index in <List>)`
* List`.Count();`
* List`.IndexOf("element_find")`; return index or -1
* List.Sort()
* List.Add() "Add more index"

> String

* Replace

```cs
"3ndl3arn".Replace('3', 'e');
//endlearn
"Blackcat".Replace("Black", "White");
//Whitecat
```

* s.ToUpper() / s.ToLower()
* IndexOf

```cs
string s = "This is example";
s.IndexOf("is"); // 5
s.IndexOf("not"); // -1
```

* StartsWith & EndsWith

```cs
string name = "Pywind's blog C#";

name.StartsWith("P"); // true
name.StartsWith("Pywind"); // true

name.EndsWith("blog"); // false

```

* Split

```cs
string s = "Welcome to my blog";
string[] words = s.Split(' '); //["Welcome", "to", "my", "blog"]
```

* Substring

```cs
string name = "A string to test !";
// from index a to b
name.substring(0, 4) // A str
name.substring(2, 7) // string
```

# Object-Oriented Programming in **C#**

## Create a Class

To create a class, use the `class` keyword:

```cs
class <Name>
{
    <access range><component>;
}
```

E.g:

```cs
class Animal
{
    public double Weight;
    public double Height;

    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(" Animal is running. . .");
    }
}
```

### Create an Object

by `new` operator:

```cs
<Name_class> Name_Obj = new Name_class();
```

> Class is the reference data type, is stored on the heap

### Fields

Call attributions:

Variables, methods inside a class are called fields, and that you can access them by creating an object of the class and by using the dot syntax (.).

```cs
<Name object>.<method>(<reference>);
```

### **Encapsulation**

To control the visibility of class members (the security level of each individual class and class member).
{: .notice}
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

declare attributes as `private`
provide `public` get and set methods, through attributes, to access and update the value of a `private` field
{: .notice}

### Access specifiers and meaning

| Modifier | Description  |
|:---|:---|
|  `public` | Unlimited, access anywhere  |
|  `private` | Only accessible inside the class  |
| `protected`  |  Like `private` and accessible from derived classes |
| `internal`  |  access in the same project |
| `protected internal`  | Like `internal` and accessible from derived classes   |

> Since it doesn't specify keywords, the class will have `internal`.

### Properties (Get and Set)

* The query methods should start with the **get** keyword and be followed by the name of the property
* The update methods should start with the **set** keyword followed by the property name.
* If the property is boolean, the query method name must begin with the keyword **is** and be followed by the property name.
* The update method return type void and have 1 parameter passed with the same type as the data type of the property.
* Syntax:

```cs
<data type> <name of property>

    {
        get { return <name of property>; }
        set { <name of property> = value; }

    }
```

E.g:

```cs
private double diemLy;
public double DiemLy
{
get { return diemLy; }
set { diemLy = value; }
}
```

* Depending on the needs and security, the programmer can prevent value assignment or prevent data from being obtained by omitting the corresponding keyword.

```cs
set
{
    if (value <= 10 && value >=0 )
    {
        phys = value;
    }
}
```

### Automatic Properties (Short Hand)

A way to use short-hand / automatic properties, where you do not have to define the field for the property, and you only have to write get; and set; inside the property.

```cs
class Person
{
  private string Name  // property
  { get; set; }
}
```

## Constructor and Destructor

### Constructor

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The advantage of a constructor, is that it is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for attributes.

Constructor has two types:

* no arguments
  * initializes default values ​​for attributes inside the class on object initialization
* arguments
  * When the object is instantiated for this method to be called, we need to pass all the parameters.
  * to initialize values ​​for attributes inside the class during object initialization

```cs
// no argument

public Cat()
{
    Weight = 1.5; // Default values
    Height = 10;
}

// has argument

public Cat(int w, int h)
{
    Weight = w;
    Height = h;
}
```

### Destructor

> Special methods are called before an object is retrieved.

* Having the same name as the class name, but to distinguish it from the constructor, we add a "~" sign before the class name.
* There is no return type.
* If you do not declare destructor, C # will automatically create a default destructor.
* There is only 1 destructor in 1 layer.

### Static members

> Sometimes a programmer wants a certain property to be shared by all objects (to be allocated only one memory area). Since then the concept of static members came into being.

Characteristics:

* Initialized **once** only after compiling the program.
* Can be **used for all** subjects.
* **Called by class name**.
* Have: **static variable, static method, static class, static constructor**.
  
#### Static variable

```cs
<access range> static <data type> <name_variable> = <values>;
```

E.g:

```cs
public static int Count = 0;
```

#### Static method

* Static method is common function of class. Called by class name, no initialize, avoid waste of memory.
* Support to write utilities function.
  
```cs
<access> static <return type> <name_method>
{
    // purpose inside
}
```

#### Static class

* Can contain static methods, static variables.

```cs
<access range> static class <name_class>

{
// attributes
}
```

## Inheritance

* build a new class from an existing class.
  * A new class is called *subclass* or *derived class*.
  * An existing class is called a *superclass* or a *base class*.
* Reuse and easy to upgrade, easy to maintain.

To inherit from a class, use the `:` symbol.

Syntax:

```cs
class <name_subclass> : <superclass>
{

}
```

E.g:

```cs
class Vehicle  // base class (parent)
{
  public string brand = "Ford";  // Vehicle field
  public void honk()             // Vehicle method
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Bruh, Bruh!");
  }
}

class Car : Vehicle  // derived class (child)
{
  public string modelName = "Mustang";  // Car field
}
```

### The sealed Keyword

If you don't want other classes to inherit from a class, use the sealed keyword:

```cs
sealed class Vehicle
{
  ...
}

class Car : Vehicle
{
  ...
}
```

'Car': cannot derive from sealed type 'Vehicle'
{: .notice}

### Issues in inheritance

> The superclass default constructor is always called every time an object of the subclass is initialized. And called before the subclass constructor.
> Subclass must have a corresponding constructor and call the superclass constructor method through the keyword **base**.

Syntax:

```cs
public <name_class>(<parameter list of subclass>) : base(<parameter list>)
{
    //content
}
```

* `parameter list` is the parameter list corresponding to the constructor of the superclass.

E.g:

```cs
class Animal
    {
        public Animal(double w, double h, int l)
        {
            Weight = w;
            Height = h;
            Legs = l;
        }
    }

class Cat : Animal
    {
        public Cat()
        {
            Weight = 1500;
            Height = 20;
            Leg = 4;
        }
        public Cat(double w, double h, int l) : base(w, h, l)
        {
            //
        }
    }
```

* In C # there is support for the **new** keyword to mark this as a **new** function and the function inheriting from the superclass will be masked so that the outside cannot be called.

> An object of the superclass can refer to the memory of an object belonging to the subclass, but otherwise cannot.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

### Virtual and override

* Virtual is the keyword used to declare a virtual method (virtual methods are overridden methods).
* Override is the keyword used to mark the method that overrides the method of the superclass.

Note: {: .notice}

* Only override virtual or abstract methods.
* Polymorphism is only shown when the superclass method is overridden.

E.g:

```cs
class Animal  // Base class (parent)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
    Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object

    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
}
```

The output will be:

```cs
The animal makes a sound
The animal makes a sound
The animal makes a sound
```

We need to override the animalSound() method of the superclass (Animal class) and to override it, we need to declare the animalSound() method of the superclass as a virtual method.
{: .notice}

```cs
class Animal  // Base class (parent)
{
  public virtual void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (child)
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}
```

Now, output will be:

```cs
The animal makes a sound
The pig says: wee wee
The dog says: bow wow
```

## Abstraction

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

* **Virtual** method is a virtual method and has no internal definition.
* **Abstract** is the keyword used to declare an abstract class or a pure virtual method.
* **Abstract class** is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class)
* **Abstract method**: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

E.g:

```cs
abstract class Animal
{
  public abstract void animalSound();
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}
```

From the example above, it is not possible to create an object of the Animal class:

```cs
Animal myObj = new Animal();
```

**Warning**: Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'Animal'
{: .notice}

* When implementing abstract on the superclass. We can *override* from subclass. *The parent class has no inner definition.*

**Note**: When inheriting an abstract class you are required to override all pure virtual methods to ensure program validity.
{: .notice}

E.g:

```cs
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}

// Derived class (inherit from Animal)
class Pig : Animal
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}
```

### Interfaces

An interface is a completely **abstract class**, which can only contain `abstract` methods and properties (with empty bodies)

E.g:

```cs
// interface
interface Animal
{
  void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
```

**Note**: Interfaces can contain properties and methods, but not fields.
{: .notice}

To access the `interface` methods, the interface must be "implemented" (like inherited) by another class. To implement an interface, use the `:` symbol (just like inheritance). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class. Note that you do not have to use the override keyword when implementing an interface:

```cs
// Interface
interface IAnimal
{
  void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the IAnimal interface
class Pig : IAnimal
{
  public void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}
```

> It is considered good practice to start with the letter "I" at the beginning of an interface, as it makes it easier for yourself and others to remember that it is an interface and not a class.
